This is a project inside The Odin Project where i'm going to create a simple recipe webpage using only HTML

Finished the project, kinda went a bit overboard with the pizza recipe because it has a lot of ingredients and steps

Did a little bit of research as well regarding git because I found it a little bit of a hassle to click the button instead of a keyboard shortcut to accept the committed message.

Kinda getting now why people are like binding git add . commit and push on a hotkey because you really will do it a lot. Tho the question for me is is it a common practice to push as well or just git add . and git commit? Will find out later I guess the more I get deeper into The Odin project.

Very fun and a really nice refresher course for the HTML and git, looking forward for more!
